Setup
=====

CloudReg is designed to be used in the cloud. We chose to work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the below setup instructions are for that.

Requirements
------------
- AWS account
- IAM Role and User with credentials to access EC2 and S3
- S3 Bucket to store raw data
- S3 Bucket to store processed data
- EC2 instance with Docker 
- EC2 instance with MATLAB
- CloudFront CDN with HTTP/2 enabled for fast visualization
- Web Application Firewall for IP-address restriction on data access.

Create AWS account
------------------

Follow instructions `here <https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start>`_ to create AWS account or use existing AWS account. All of the following AWS setup instructions should be performed within the same AWS account.

8. Click `Next`
9. Click `Next` on the `Add Tags` screen. Adding tags is optional.
10. On the `Review Role` screen, choose a role name, like `cloudreg_role`, and customize the description as you see fit.
11. Finally, click `Create Role`

2. Navigate to `EC2 section <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/>`_ of console
3. In the left sidebar, click `Instances`. Make sure you change the region (top right, middle drop-down menu) to match that of your raw data and processed data S3 buckets.
4. Click `Launch Instances`
5. In the search bar, enter the following: `ami-098555c9b343eb09c`. This is an Amazing Machine Image (AMI) called `Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 38.0`. Click Select when this AMI shows up.

When the key pair pop-up appears, select `Choose an existing key pair` if you have `already created one <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ground-station/latest/ug/create-ec2-ssh-key-pair.html>`_, or select `Create a new key pair` if you do not already have one. Follow the instructions on-screen to download and save the key pair.
9. Follow `AWS tutorial <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html#ec2-instance-connect-connecting-aws-cli>`_ to connect to this EC2 instance through the command line.
10. Once you have connected to the instance via SSH, create the `cloud-volume credentials file <https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume/#aws-secretjson-and-matrix-secretjson>`_ on the instance using the CLI text editor of your choice.
11. After creating the cloud-volume credentials file, run the following command to turn off the EC2 instance: `sudo shutdown now`


Set up MATLAB EC2 instance
--------------------------

1. Follow instructions `here <https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-on-aws>` on setting up MATLAB on an EC2 instance. Be sure to create this instance in the same region as your S3 buckets.
